      <h1 class="post-title">AITA for making a psychological profile to solve a case?</h1>

      <div class="post-body">
        <p><b>Hi everyone,</b></p>

        <p>
          I hosted a small reunion get together at my apartment last night with some old network friends. Everyone there works in some kind of scientific
          field (psychology, neuroscience, data analysis, etc.), so I would consider all of us completely 100% ethical, and I do not think anyone of us
          would ever lie in any setting for our own personal benefit, even if it was the right thing to do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyways at one point, I went to play music, and my (very expensive) speaker was gone. No one admitted to taking it, and we searched the
          apartment for a while with no luck.
        </p>

        <p>
          I suggested we try to draw up a psychological profile of who would be most likely to take it based on behavior, personality patterns, and prior
          tendencies. I had previously heard at work that psychological profiles can be used to solve cases, and I know some people claim that it is just a
          myth but I am pretty sure it is true.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to be clear: I wasn’t accusing anyone, I was just using logical inference to solve the case of my missing speaker.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back, I can kinda see that this relied heavily on inductive reasoning (drawing conclusions about an individual based on generalized
          behavioral patterns) but we still went ahead with it, because it was the best option. We had no physical evidence, so how else were we supposed to
          find out who stole my speaker?
        </p>

        <p>The profile we came up with included these traits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technical skill</li>
          <li>Comfort bending rules</li>
          <li>Desire for recognition</li>
          <li>History of elaborate planning</li>
          <li>Impulsive personality</li>
          <li>Antisocial personality disorder behaviours</li>
          <li>No issue lying/deceiving your friends</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One friend in particular (let’s call him X) matched a lot of these traits. Some people started questioning him more directly. He got defensive and upset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, things got a little tense. Once the profile was established, it became the main way people interpreted what was happening. In retrospect
          we focused less on the physical environment, timeline, and who had moved through the room, and more so on who seemed to match our psychological
          profile to find out who stole my speaker.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know one of you will probably say that we used confirmation bias, and that we had tunnel vision, but new information was interpreted in ways that
          supported the profile, so we went with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          So… <b>AITA for suggesting psychological profiling to solve this case instead of just letting it go?</b>
        </p>
        <p>I genuinely thought it was a rational approach.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- EDIT / UPDATE -->
      <div class="post-edit">
        <p>
          <strong>EDIT / UPDATE</strong> Update: We found the speaker. It was accidentally knocked off the table, cracked, and then hidden in a closet by
          someone who did not want to get blamed for breaking it. No one stole anything. Also was able to get it fixed, I had insurance on it lol.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Reflecting on this, I can see that once we started profiling, it probably made it harder for anyone to speak up. The moment a psychological
          profile was introduced, it stopped working as a hypothesis, and started becoming a label.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          One of my friends told me that research in criminal psychology consistently shows that profiling lacks strong predictive validity, and is highly
          vulnerable to subjective interpretation.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          In this situation, the profile did not help us solve the problem. Instead, it just damaged our relationship with our buddy X (we made it up to him
          with food and drinks later). We only reached clarity once we stopped accusing based on a profile, and started asking what physically could have
          happened in the room.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          I still think profiling can be a really useful tool in certain situations, but it shouldn’t become the basis for solving cases and accusing someone
          without physical evidence, contextual reconstruction, and alternative explanations.
        </p>

              <b>NTA.</b> Profiling is literally used in criminal investigations. People are uncomfortable when logic points toward them, but that does not
              mean the logic is wrong. You did not accuse, you inferred.

                      Exactly. Profiling is not random guessing, it is pattern recognition. People hear “profile” and think it is vibes, but it is based on
                      observed behavior over time. If someone fits multiple traits, that is not coincidence.

                              Thank you. Everyone here is acting like probability does not matter. No one is saying it is 100%, but ignoring behavioral
                              likelihood because it is “uncomfortable” makes no sense. Investigations are about narrowing possibilities. Usually the simplest
                              explanation is the correct one.

              Honestly, this sounds like people reacting emotionally instead of rationally. Profiling is not about blaming someone, it is about identifying
              likelihoods. If certain traits show up repeatedly, it makes sense to factor that in when something goes missing.

                      Agreed. When you do not have direct evidence, you work with probabilities. That does not mean anyone is guilty, it means you are trying
                      to narrow possibilities instead of guessing randomly.

            <p>I think people misunderstand what profiling is.</p>
            <p>
              It is not “this person did it,” it is “given what we know, this explanation seems more plausible than others.” Humans infer traits from
              behavior all the time. Profiling just makes that process explicit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem is when people treat the profile like proof, instead of a hypothesis to test against the scene and the timeline.

              I am conflicted. I get wanting a framework, but those traits are broad. They do not explain when or how anything happened. They just describe
              a type of person.

            <p>That is a weak substitute for evidence, and it can easily turn into tunnel vision.</p>

                      Yeah, it skips the boring but important stuff. Timeline, movement through space, physical layout. Personality feels explanatory, but it

                              This is a fundamental attribution error. Explaining a situation with a personality based profile instead of context. Once that

                                      Also, once someone feels labeled, it changes how they act. People go quiet or defensive because they feel judged. Then
                                      that gets interpreted as suspicious. Profiling can shape behavior, not just interpret it.

              After the update, I can see the issue. Y'all only got clarity once u stopped asking who would do this and started asking what physically could
              have happened. That shift mattered more than any kind of profile.

              Serious question: did anyone retrace movement through the room before profiling? Who walked past the table, where the stand was, whether it
              could have fallen? Reconstruction usually beats guessing motives.

              I do not think suggesting profiling automatically makes you an AH, but it became the dominant lens too fast. Once everyone agreed on a
              profile, other explanations stopped being taken seriously. That is where it became tunnel vision.

                      Exactly. Profiling can be a starting point, but the moment it feels more convincing than physical, and other forms of concrete evidence,
                      you are not investigating. You are telling a story and perpetuating a narrative.

              Not proud of it, but I can see why someone would hide the broken speaker. Once everyone is staring at you and reading intent into everything,
              admitting a mistake feels ten times worse.

              The issue is not “profiling exists,” it is how quickly it turns into a judgment of moral character. A profile can be a hypothesis and starting
              point, but in a group setting it becomes a label, and labels carry stigma.

              Fairs. I can see now that we treated plausibility like evidence. Once we had a suspect in mind, everything started to look like confirmation.
              That one is on me for introducing it and not keeping it strictly hypothetical.

                        No. fMRI is not a lie detector, and this is exactly the problem. You are reaching for something that sounds scientific to avoid doing
                        basic evidence work.

              For future reference, start with tangible factors. Where was the speaker, who walked by it, what changed, and what physical traces exist. You

              I would focus on repairing the relationship with X. Even if you did not intend to accuse him, the group dynamic turned it into an accusation.
              A sincere apology plus acknowledging the bias will go a long way. An old friend once told me that Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its
              source. True humility is the only antidote to shame, so have some and apologize!

              I'm glad the speaker was found, but I hope you understand how it felt. When you fit a criteria, you stop being a person and become a theory.
